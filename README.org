** Install
   #+begin_src sh
   brew install ammonite-repl
   #+end_src

   It is recommended installed by the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][MELPA]] package system.

   You could install it by ~M-x~: with ~package-install~: ~ammonite-term-repl~.

** Usage
   To start an ammonite repl, you can just hit ~M-x:~ with ~run-ammonite~

   #+begin_src elisp
   (add-hook 'scala-mode-hook
             (lambda ()
               (ammonite-term-repl-minor-mode t)))
   #+end_src
  
** Keybindings
| ammonite-term-repl             | "C-`" or "C-c C-z" |
| ammonite-term-repl-send-defun  | "C-c C-e"          |
| ammonite-term-repl-send-region | "C-c C-r"          |
| ammonite-term-repl-load-file   | "C-c C-l"          |

** Hooks
   ~ammonite-term-repl-minor-mode-hook~
   ~ammonite-term-repl-run-hook~

** Variables
   ~ammonite-term-repl-program-args~

   An example
   #+begin_src elisp
   (setq ammonite-term-repl-program-args '("-s" "--no-default-predef"))
   #+end_src

** Why not comint-mode
   Because ~(make-comint "amm")~ throws a =Exec format error=.
   Run ~amm~ in *eshell* also get the same error.
